Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project is based on books and authors.
Each of the four pages has their specific information displayed
along with specific functionality used.

It consists of four pages:

1. index.html is the main page of the site which uses mixed functionality
2. lit.html is containing functionality of image, table and a
   list (unordered/ordered)
3. style.html is containing functionality of css selectors specifically
4. bootstrap.html uses the bootstrap framework for responsive design for
   smaller screens
